                <h2>History of Horror</h2>
                <p> A horror film is one that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes.
                    Horror films additionally aim to evoke viewers' nightmares, revulsions and terror of the unknown or the macabre. 
                    Initially inspired by literature from authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror has 
                    existed as a film genre for more than a century. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction, 
                    and thriller genres.Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage
                    into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include ghosts, vampires, werewolves, evil witches, cults, black magic, 
                    demons and demonic possession, Satanism and the Devil, monsters, mummies, extraterrestrials, zombies, dystopian or 
                    apocalyptic worlds, disturbed children, gore and torture, cannibalism, natural forces, evil clowns, psychopaths and serial killers.

                <p> If you’re exploring the history of horror movies, you need context. Horror films don’t exist in a vacuum, nor are they based on a fixed set of ideas. 
                    They evolve with the zeitgeist, reflecting and provoking pop culture discourse. Horror offers us a fictional space in which we can share and evaluate our 
                    collective fears – whatever they may be at the time. Scary movies allow us to stare down whichever one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse – Pestilence, 
                    War, Famine, Death – is currently leading the charge. They also let us examine the darkest possibilities of new concepts in science and technology. 
                    Despite religious and government censorship, they serve a wider moral purpose, reinforcing social taboos and demonstrating the macabre 
                    fate of those who transgress against our collective rules. Audiences, especially the youthful 15-24 demographic that has shaped horror 
                    since the 1950s, evolve too. We continually seek out new thrills and fresh scares. New horror movies must be relevant, or risk losing their 
                    bite: what was terrifying yesterday might seem a non-issue tomorrow. Generation by generation, we work through our shared traumas and move 
                    on to the next iteration. In the 1970s, people worried about mutations in unborn babies triggered by thalidomide or Agent Orange. Today, 
                    that threat is forgotten and we’re much more concerned about the damage caused in utero by microplastics.
                    Despite frequent hand wringing about its demise, the horror genre is a cultural constant. We’ve terrified each other with tales that trigger 
                    the less logical parts of our imaginations for as long as we’ve told stories. From the ballads of the ancient world to modern urban myths, 
                    audiences flock to sadistic storytellers to be scared witless –and remain happy to pay for the privilege. Over the past century or more, 
                    horror movies have consistently succeeded at the box office. As the horrors of climate change, over-population, income inequality, and who 
                    knows what else loom on the horizon, they won’t be fading away any time soon.
